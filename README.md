# BetterDiscordPlugins
## Nitro Adblock
Prevents Nitro ads from existing in the DMs list.

Specifically, this plugin removes the "Nitro" channel.

## CrowdedControlPanel
You have 10 different plugins, each of them adding their own button to the control panel at the bottom-left corner. That's a lot of buttons. Of course, fitting all that on one row breaks everyone's eyes. This plugin tries to solve that by placing the username and the buttons on separate lines.

## SeeNoLoading
Removes the loading indicator for PluginRepo and ThemeRepo.
